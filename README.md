# Numerical Methods' Algorithms
## Some Implemented methods for numerical analysis  including
* Newtons' interpolation technique
* Lagrange interpolation technique
* EigenValues and EigenVectors
* Least Squares Regression
* Numerical Differentiation
* Numerical Integration
#### Note that: these methods have been implemented without the knwoledge of their originaly made algorithms
